# This is a workflow to perform a migration check on each pull request that is branched off master / main. There are two rules that this workflow will confirm :
# a) If the PR includes migration changes it should have a branch name that starts with 'db_migrate'.
# b) If the PR that includes migration changes should also not include any feature changes.
